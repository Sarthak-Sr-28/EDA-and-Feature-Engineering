# Zomato-EDA
This project involves an in-depth analysis of a cleaned Zomato dataset covering restaurants across various countries. The objective is to explore and understand the distribution, trends, and relationships within the data through comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and graphical visualizations using Python.

Key components of the analysis include:

**Data Cleaning:** Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant data.<br>
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performing statistical and visual analysis to uncover patterns and insights in the data.<br>
**Visualizations:** Utilizing Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of the data, including bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and more.<br>
**Observations:** Highlighting significant findings and trends discovered through the analysis.<br><br>
This project aims to provide valuable insights into the global restaurant industry based on the Zomato dataset, assisting in better understanding consumer preferences and restaurant performance across different regions.
